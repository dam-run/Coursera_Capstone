It can be difficult to figure out where the best place to move would be. There are many factors that could bring people to a certain location and it would be convenient to have an app that would give insight to a location that would best suit an individual. One issue that people may have when trying to find a place to live is the distance from the home in which they move into, to specific types of venues. Of course, there are other factors that could be considered however, for the scope of this project we will only consider venues. Using the Foursquare API, we will be able to pull venue data based off of certain locations.
