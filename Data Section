The data that will be used for this project will be the zip codes in a large city. For this project, I am choosing a larger city, 
Houston, TX, to carry out the analysis. The zip codes will be scrapped from a website and then geopy will be used to obtain the 
latitude and longitude information for the given zip codes so that we can use the Foursquare API.
